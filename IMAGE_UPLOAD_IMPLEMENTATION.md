# Image Upload Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds support for uploading image files (JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, WebP) to the card import system. Users can now upload screenshots, photos of card checklists, or scanned catalogs for AI-powered card data extraction.

## Frontend Components Added

### 1. Enhanced Import Service (`src/services/imports.ts`)
- Added `uploadImage()` method that calls `/admin/imports/upload-image`
- Enhanced error handling for specific HTTP status codes (400, 500, 502, 504)
- Follows same API pattern as existing CSV/HTML uploads

### 2. File Upload Component (`src/components/FileUpload.tsx`)
- Drag & drop support for all file types
- File validation with appropriate error messages
- Support for all backend-specified image formats
- File size validation (10MB limit for images, 5MB for others)
- Clean UI with file preview and removal options

### 3. Image Preview Component (`src/components/ImagePreview.tsx`)
- Shows selected image before upload
- Displays file name and size
- Automatic cleanup of object URLs
- Only visible in image mode

### 4. Upload Progress Component (`src/components/UploadProgress.tsx`)
- Multi-stage progress indicator for image processing
- Realistic timing based on 30-60 second processing time
- Different progress patterns for CSV/HTML vs Image uploads
- Visual feedback with progress bar and status messages

### 5. Image Upload Help Component (`src/components/ImageUploadHelp.tsx`)
- Guidelines for best image types (checklists, screenshots, etc.)
- Supported format badges (JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, WebP)
- Tips for better AI extraction results
- Processing time expectations

### 6. Image Upload Hook (`src/hooks/useImageUpload.ts`)
- Reusable hook for image file validation and state management
- Automatic preview URL creation and cleanup
- Comprehensive file validation (type, size, format)
- Error handling with descriptive messages

## Updated Components

### Import Upload Page (`src/pages/ImportUploadPage.tsx`)
- Added IMAGE mode toggle button
- Integrated all new components
- Updated loading messages for image processing
- Enhanced workflow instructions and tips
- Progress indicator during upload

## API Integration

The frontend now properly integrates with the backend `/admin/imports/upload-image` endpoint:

```typescript
// Form data structure matches backend expectations
const formData = new FormData()
formData.append('file', file)
formData.append('brand', metadata.brand)
formData.append('set_name', metadata.set_name)
formData.append('year', String(metadata.year))
formData.append('sport', metadata.sport)
if (metadata.release_date) formData.append('release_date', metadata.release_date)
if (metadata.source) formData.append('source', metadata.source)
```

## User Workflow

1. **Select Image Mode**: Click the "IMAGE" toggle button
2. **Upload Image**: Drag & drop or click to select image file
3. **Preview**: View selected image and file details
4. **Process**: Click "Upload & Preview" to send to AI processing
5. **Review**: Same preview/resolve/commit flow as CSV/HTML

## Next Steps for Backend Integration

When you implement the backend endpoint, ensure:

1. **Endpoint**: `POST /admin/imports/upload-image`
2. **Response Format**: Same as CSV/HTML uploads (`UploadPreviewResponse`)
3. **Error Codes**: 400 (invalid file), 500 (server error), 502 (AI error), 504 (timeout)
4. **Processing**: Extract card data from image using AI vision
5. **Validation**: Support all specified image formats

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Try uploading different image formats
2. Test file size validation (>10MB should fail)
3. Test invalid file types
4. Verify error handling
5. Check that the workflow continues normally after successful upload

The frontend is now ready to handle image uploads once you implement the backend endpoint!
