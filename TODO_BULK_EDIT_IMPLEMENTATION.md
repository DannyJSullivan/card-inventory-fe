# Bulk Edit Cards Restoration - Implementation Plan

## ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Bulk Edit Functionality Restored!

The bulk editing functionality for cards during the import process has been successfully restored and enhanced. All key features are now implemented and working.

## üéØ **Current State Analysis**

### ‚úÖ **Working Features**
- **Backend APIs**: All bulk edit endpoints exist and are implemented in `src/services/imports.ts`
  - `bulkEditCards(batchId, edits)` - Edit multiple cards simultaneously  
  - `mergeCards(batchId, request)` - Combine multiple cards into one
  - `splitCard(batchId, request)` - Split one card into multiple cards
  - `deleteCardSection(batchId, cardType)` - Delete entire card type sections
- **Individual editing**: CardEditModal works for single card edits
- **Types**: All TypeScript interfaces are defined in `src/types/imports.ts`
- **‚úÖ Bulk selection UI**: Checkboxes for selecting multiple cards
- **‚úÖ Bulk operations UI**: Complete merge/split/bulk edit controls 
- **‚úÖ Card selection state**: Full state management for selected cards
- **‚úÖ Bulk edit modal**: Interface for editing multiple cards at once
- **‚úÖ Card merge modal**: UI for merging multiple cards into one
- **‚úÖ Card split modal**: UI for splitting single cards into multiple
- **‚úÖ Section deletion**: Ability to delete entire card type sections

### 3. **‚úÖ Comprehensive Bulk Edit Components**

#### **BulkEditModal** (`src/components/BulkEditModal.tsx`)
- Edit common fields across multiple selected cards
- Checkbox-based field selection (only edit what you want to change)
- Support for all card fields: number, type, title, subset, notes, flags, players
- Smart validation ensuring at least one field is selected
- Preserves existing data for unchecked fields

- Customizable card numbers (1a, 1b, etc.)
- Attribute inheritance option from source card
- Dynamic player assignment per split card

### 4. **‚úÖ Enhanced User Experience**

#### **Selection Management**

### 5. **‚úÖ Section Management**
- **Delete Section**: Remove entire card type sections with confirmation
- Integrated with existing section controls
- Auto-clears selections when sections are deleted
- Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental deletions

## üîß **Technical Implementation Details**

### **State Management Architecture**
```typescript
// Dual-state approach for efficiency
const [selectedCards, setSelectedCards] = useState<Record<number, boolean>>({})
const [selectedCardData, setSelectedCardData] = useState<Record<number, CardRow>>({})

// Smart selection handlers
const toggleCardSelection = (cardId: number, cardData?: CardRow) => {
  // Updates both selection state and card data cache
}

const selectAllInType = (cardRows: CardRow[]) => {
  // Bulk selection with data caching
}
```

### **Component Integration Pattern**
- Props passed down from ImportResolvePage to CardTypeSection
- Event handlers bubble up for state management
- Modal components receive selected data and update callbacks
- Automatic data refresh after successful operations

### **API Integration**
- Uses existing `importService` functions for all operations
- Proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- React Query integration for cache invalidation
- Loading states and progress indicators

## üìÅ **Files Modified/Created**
